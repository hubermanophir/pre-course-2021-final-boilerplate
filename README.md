# Main features 

1. You can add to do items, they will be added at the end of the list.
2. To do can be set with a priority ranging from 1-5.
3. You have the number of current todos to the left of the add button.
4. To do items can be sorted using the sort button, items will be sorted from the highest priority to the lowest.
5. List items are persistent using jsonbin.io to save the current list. The same list is loaded when page is refreshed. You will get notified in the console whether adding a certain to do item was successful or not.

once you click on the edit button the text inside the item can be changed, the pencil icon will be changed to a check mark just like so :

by clicking the check mark you will confirm your edit. The list will then be updated in jsonbin.io and the local storage.

3. Empty todos : once clicked the list will be emptied.

4. Dark mode: on the upper right of the screen you can see the selection between the regular mode which is shown above and the dark mode which can be easier on your eyes :) it looks like this :
