# Main Features 

1. Adding "To Do" items to the list. Each new "To Do" item is added at the end of the list
2. "To Do" items can be set with a priority rank, ranging from 1-5.
3. Left to the "Add" button, is the current count of "To Do" items.
4. "To Do" items can be sorted descending using the "Sort" button.
5. "To Do" items are automatically saved under "jsonbin.io" which makes them persistent across devices and browsers


# Extra Features

1. "Delete" option next to each "To Do" task :

Pressing the button generated a popup asking whether to complete the action.


2. "Edit" button next to each "To Do" item:

Upon clicking the pencil icon a check mark will appear in its place:

Once the check mark appears the user can change the "To Do" item name by *double clicking*.  Clicking the check mark confirms the edit. "To Do" list will be updated in "jsonbin.io" and locally.

3. "Empty Todos" : When clicked, list is emptied.

4. "Dark" Mode: On the upper right hand corner of the screen a toggle option between "regular" mode (depicted above) and "dark" mode. See below:

5. Used media query in css to make the website more compatible with phones :
